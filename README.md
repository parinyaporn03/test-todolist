### 🧠 Implementation Choices & Reasoning
🛠️ Frameworks & Tools
- React + Vite: Chosen for fast development experience and modern tooling. Vite provides lightning-fast hot module replacement and simpler configuration compared to Webpack.
- TypeScript: Adds type safety and improves developer experience with autocomplete, catching bugs at compile time.
- Tailwind CSS: For rapid UI styling using utility classes. It keeps styles close to components and avoids class name conflicts.
- RTK Query: The primary tool for managing API requests and server state. RTK Query significantly reduces boilerplate code and handles data fetching, caching, loading, and error states automatically. 

📌 Future Improvements
- Add user authentication
- Add due dates and filters
- Deploy to Vercel or Netlify
